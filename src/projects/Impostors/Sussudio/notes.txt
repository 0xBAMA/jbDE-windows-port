- Viewport semantics:
	- Atlas type usage is super easy, just drawing squares
	- Raster ops are kept easy in NDC, but gl_FragCoord has to be offset by the base point ( using the first two args to glViewport )
		- e.g. pixel location on viewport is gl_FragCoord - ivec2( viewportBaseX, viewportBaseY )
